## XML based Configuration file


</div>

### Description

This application has a class which handles all the code related to reading frmo and writing into an XML file. This XML file has a common structure.

I developed this so that my applications are not dependent on window's registry or INI files to store configuration information. For example, an application often requires to login into a database. For this it requires either DSN or Driver name, database server name, database name etc. Instead of hard coding this in the application, it is often read from either Window's registry or INI. But XML file is the perfect place to keep this information.

Code also shows how to use it to store configuration file as encrypted.

XML File is very easy to understand. Has only three elements (Configuration, Section and Item). So it is very easy for end-users to modify as well.
 
### More Info
 
XML File name where configuration is stored or to be retrieved from.

It uses MSXML4.0 as XML parser.
